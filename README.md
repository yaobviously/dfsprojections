DFS Projections

A  function that samples from a multivariate normal distribution to generate each player's Fantasy Points distribution. The parameters of each player's distribution are then entered into "Boom" and "Bust" functions to calculate the likelihood each player will either exceed or fail to exceed two thresholds of player value.
