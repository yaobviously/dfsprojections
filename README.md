DFS Projections

A  function that samples from a multivariate normal distribution to generate each player's Fantasy Points distribution. The parameters of each player's distribution are then entered into a "Boom" and "Bust" function that calculates the likelihood each player will: 1. Boom: exceed a value defined by their salary. 2. Bust: fail to exceed a value defined by their salary.
